## Fish outta Hell


In Fish outta hell you play an alchemist, who through no fault of his own and certainly not because he committed any war-crimes, was sent to hell and now he must fish resources by "Day" and by night, protect his goodies from Beelzebub who really is just screwing with him.


Made from scratch for Ludum Dare 52 Jam.


NOTES: We didn't finish everything we wanted and because this game is also a part of a series we're doing on our YouTube channels, we intend to finish it up over the rest of the month.
